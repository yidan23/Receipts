  Seriously, I believe git to be one of the most universally adopted and used tools in many production
  and open source environments for folks of all skill levels to learn to recognize what git is and 
  what it is not.
  
  # git is NOT 
  * A cloud based IDE
  * a private store for your code
  * a money making venture
  
  # git IS:
  * a cloud (and desktop) based collaboration tool for

  * a cool tool that all the hipsters are using
